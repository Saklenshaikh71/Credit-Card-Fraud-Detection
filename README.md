# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Description

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The project involves preprocessing credit card transaction data, training a classification model to identify fraudulent transactions, and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance. 

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Feature engineering for fraud detection.
- Training of various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualization of model performance and fraud detection insights.

## Installation
